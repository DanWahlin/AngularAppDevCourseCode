# Angular and TypeScript Hello World Project

The Hello World project is an Angular 2+ starter project that has the npm modules, 
configuration, scripts and folders and routing in place to make getting started 
with an Angular project easy!

Here's what is in the project:

* Angular scripts and TypeScript configuration are ready to go
* Angular bootstrapper wired up to the app module
* A simple app component 
* Bootstrap for CSS

This is a very simple "Hello World" project to help get you started.
