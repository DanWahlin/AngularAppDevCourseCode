## Behind a Corporate Proxy?

If you're behind a proxy you'll need to configure your proxy server with npm:

npm config set proxy http://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port

npm config set https-proxy https://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port

You'll also need to set the following environment variables in order for the lab setup
process to work correctly and get out through the proxy:

#### Windows

setx HTTP_PROXY      http://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port

setx HTTPS_PROXY     https://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port

#### Mac

export HTTP_PROXY      http://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port

export HTTPS_PROXY     https://user_name:password@proxy.company.com:your_proxy_port
