  TODO 4: Retrieving a Customer Object to Bind to the Form

  1. Add the following code into the ngOnInit() function below:
     
      this.route.parent?.params.subscribe((params: Params) => {
        let id = +params['id'];
        if (id !== 0) {
          this.operationText = 'Update';
          this.getCustomer(id);
        }
      });

      This code is similar to code you wrote in the routing lab. It accesses
      a route parameter named "id" that is on the parent route.

   2. Immediately AFTER the previous code (still in ngOnInit) add code to 
      do the following:
      
      a. Call dataService's getStates() function.

      b. Subscribe to the Observable that is returned from getStates(). When creating
         the subscribe use an arrow function that accepts the following parameter:
      
         states: IState[]

      c. Assign the states parameter value that's returned to the component's
         `states` property.

         Note: If you need help with the previous steps refer to the course manual 
         (the Http section) or to the lab's end solution code. The next TODO
         may also provide a hint to help with completing this step.

        TODO 5: Updating a Customer Object
       
        1. Add the following code into immediately below the TODO comment to pass
          the customer object to DataService's updateCustomer() function.
        
          this.dataService.updateCustomer(this.customer)
            .subscribe((status: boolean) => {
              if (status) {


              } else {
                const msg = 'Unable to update customer';
                this.growler.growl(msg, GrowlerMessageType.Danger);
                this.errorMessage = msg;
              }
          },
          (err: any) => this.logger.log(err));

        2. Within the "if (status) { }" code you added in the previous task, add the following code to 
           mark the form as pristine and use a growler service (a message display service) to display
           a message to the user:

            // Mark form as pristine so that CanDeactivateGuard won't prompt before navigation
            this.customerForm.form.markAsPristine();
            this.growler.growl('Operation performed successfully.', GrowlerMessageType.Success);

           Why are we marking the form as pristine? The canDeactivate guard
           discussed in the routing chapter calls into the component to check if there is any 
           dirty data. If there is it prompts the user to leave. Since we're updating a 
           customer here we don't want to prompt the user.

  TODO 7: Determining if the User Can Leave the Form
  
  1. Open ./can-deactivate.guard.ts and note that it calls into the CustomerEditComponent's
     canDeactivate() function (defined below) to determine if it's OK to leave the view. If the
     form is dirty and has unsaved changes we want to prompt the user before navigating to another route.

  2. Add the following code after the `Add code here` comment in canDeactive() to let the route guard know if the 
     form is dirty or not:

    if (!this.customerForm.dirty) {
      return true;
    }

  3. Note that the remaining code in the canDeactivate() function displays a modal dialog to the user using the 
     modalService if the form is dirty and the user tries to navigate to a different route.
