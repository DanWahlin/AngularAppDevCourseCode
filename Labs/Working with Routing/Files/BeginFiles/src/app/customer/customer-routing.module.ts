  TODO 1: Defining a Root Route and Child Routes

  1. Add the following route definition (which includes an "id" route parameter) into the 
     routes constant below:

      { 
        path: 'customers/:id', 
        component: CustomerComponent,
        children: [

        ]
      }

  2. Add the following child route paths and associated components into the children property array
     that you added in the previous step:

      Path        Component
      ____________________________________

      orders      CustomerOrdersComponent
      details     CustomerDetailsComponent 
      edit        CustomerEditComponent

      Hint: You define child routes using the same syntax as the route in step 1 above.

    TODO 4: Exploring Routing Components

    Note that the components property below contains all of the components used
    in the routes. This technique was shown earlier (in the customers routing) but as a review, the 
    components are defined here so that we don't have to import them again in the feature
    module (CustomerModule in this example). Not a required technique, but something that can be used 
    to minimize the number of imports in the feature module.
